# WTL - Wacky TLauncher

Injects a new button into the TLauncher menu to collapse the UI.
You can choose to collapse or expand the window using the arrow
button that replaces the 'TL mods' button.

![demo](https://github.com/Egsagon/WTL/blob/master/demo.png)

## Usage

Download the `WTL.py` file and each time you want to open TL,
execute it (you mayh want to createa a shortcut or something).

## Disclaimer

Very unstable (its just a TK window that draws itself on top of the 
launcher). Hover is not very well handled.
